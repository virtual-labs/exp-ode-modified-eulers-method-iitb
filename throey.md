<p>The Modified Euler's Method, also known as the Heun's Method or the Improved Euler's Method, is a numerical technique used for approximating solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is an extension of the Euler's Method, providing better accuracy by using a more sophisticated approach for estimating the slope of the solution curve.

Otherwise we can use following formulas also for various values of n

<p>The Modified Euler's Method is particularly useful when a higher level of accuracy is required compared to Euler's Method but more computational complexity is acceptable compared to higher-order methods like the Runge-Kutta methods
